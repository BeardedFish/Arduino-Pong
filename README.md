# Arduino-Pong

This project is a Pong game created using an Arduino Uno as the base. The project can be played via any IR remote such as a TV remote. The oppoent player is computer based.

The parts required for this project are:
1. A breadboard
2. Jumper wires
3. IR sensor
4. Arduino Uno
5. 1.8" TFT LCD
6. Speaker
7. Breadboard power module
8. An IR remote (such as a TV remote)

**NOTE:** Please know that you can power the entire project without the breadboard power module. If you are going to use the breadboard power module then you are going to need a USB cable plugged into the breadboard power module, having the other end of the USB cable plugged into the Arduino. You are also going to need to have power going into the breadboard power module (such as a 9V battery).
